###################### PREFACE ###################### 

This mod is heavily under development and is also thought as an entry point or 
template for other new modders to learn from. 

I'm no artist at all - so I'm really not good with graphics. 

If you have any suggestions or remark, please be friendly, but don't hold back! 
The name list is indeed still quite sparse and I'm desperately looking for names :)

This simple mod adds a new pre-defined empire: The Ironborn Dominion, which consists
of human species called the Space Vikings, who set out from their home of Nordheim
to raid the Galaxy! 


Basically I wanted to have a "Name List" in the game that contains names from norse 
mythology and/or viking history. For this I used stuff like Wikipedia articles as 
well as Snorri's Edda and a lot of semi-historic pop culture too (e.g. the series "Vikings"). 
That said, I tried to use original norse spellings but removed the special characters - 
not necessarily because Stellaris can't handle it, but because they're a pain in the ass, 
if you're trying to search your files!

And since I started with this, my first mod ever, I thought, I might also add a new
flag icon (the raven symbol that may be familiar from CK2) and a background story for the 
start screen. I also gave them their own government, but at the moment it's just a simple 
copy of the military dictatorship with different ruler names. 

For me it's just a fun little project, but I thought... hell, let's put it in the workshop
and who knows? I might even get some feedback :D
