## PREFACE

This mod is heavily under development and is also thought as an entry point or 
template for other new modders to learn from. 

I'm no artist at all - so I'm really not good with graphics. 

If you have any suggestions or remark, please be friendly, but don't hold back! 
The name list is indeed still quite sparse and I'm desperately looking for names :)

## Description / What this mod is about


This simple mod adds a new pre-defined empire: The Ironborn Dominion, which consists
of human species called the Space Vikings, who set out from their home of Nordheim
to raid the Galaxy! 

Basically I wanted to have a "Name List" in the game that contains names from norse 
mythology and/or viking history. For this I used stuff like Wikipedia articles as 
well as Snorri's Edda and a lot of semi-historic pop culture too (e.g. the series "Vikings"). 
That said, I tried to use original norse spellings but removed the special characters - 
not necessarily because Stellaris can't handle it, but because they're a pain in the ass, 
if you're trying to search your files!

And since I started with this, my first mod ever, I thought, I might also add a new
flag icon (the raven symbol that may be familiar from CK2) and a background story for the 
start screen. I also gave them their own government, but at the moment it's just a simple 
copy of the military dictatorship with different ruler names. 

For me it's just a fun little project, but I thought... hell, let's put it in the workshop
and who knows? I might even get some feedback :D

## Name list / Selection of names

I am trying to use names from either norse mythology or historic documents 
about the vikings. For the distribution of names, I chose some kind of 
not-100%-strict structure, which basically follows these rules:

__Ship names:__
  * battle ships: Huge mythological monsters and ships (i.e. one ship: Skidbladnir)
  * cruisers: Mythological wolves; Creatures that hunt;
  * destroyers: Mythological weapons; Things that destroy
  * corvettes: Mythological birds, mostly ravens; Nimble, fast creatures
  * science: Names of (mythological) seers; Everything connected to spirituality, augury, runes etc
  * constructor: Mythological creatures that build or artifacts that were crafted or constructed in any way
  * colonizer: Mythological creatures that are responsible for the creation of the world
  * generic: Actual, historical ship names(found on Wikipedia) or kennings for "ship"
  * transport: Names of smaller viking boats or boat types

__Station names:__
  * research stations: Names of (suspected) religious or cultish places 
  * outpost station: Names of historic Viking settlements
  * military stations: For large and medium stations, I'm using names of mythological buildings;
    For small stations I'm using names of locations of Viking raids

__Fleet names:__
  * Names of mythological events (and Blodörn, because it just fitted)    

__Army names:__
  * Only use sequential naming
  * Use names of Warrior groups: Historic (Vaeringjar), mythologic (Einherjar)
  * "Thrall" for the slave army because that's the name of the slaves in old norse society

__Planet names:__
  * specific planet classes: Names of the 9 mythological worlds
  * generic names: Historic names of countries / areas

__Character names:__
  * normal names: Names of historic figures, be they real or just mentioned in some historic sources
  * regnal names: Names of Jötunn / Giants from norse mythology. Sometimes they're not distinguishable from gods
